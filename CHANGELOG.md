# Changelog

## 0.2.0

* Stage rebuilds with automatic bubblewrap, user/mount-namespace, and
  documented unsandboxed install-path fallback selection.
* Publish complete trees with `renameat2(RENAME_EXCHANGE)` and a restoring
  ordinary-rename fallback for unsupported filesystems.
* Keep one `flock` across build and publish; add transactional rollback and
  interrupted-fallback recovery.
* Make dry-run report sandbox and swap decisions without invoking EasyBuild.
* Add exhaustive failure injection for build, journal, swap, module, link, and
  rollback paths.
* Name retention and kernel constants and record their sources.
* Add Org-mode how-to, reference, baseline design audit, and `open-004`
  recommendations.
